# ControlShift Labs Demo Application

You can use the [ControlShift Labs API](http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/) to create a number of useful, embedded applications from your data in ControlShift. This example application has been created to provide a general idea of how the workflow could work. It is built with jquery and [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Feel free to fork this app for your own needs!

The ControlShift Labs API documentation can be found here: [http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/](http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/).

## Developing

We set this application generally run independent of tooling dependencies. You could just open the index file in any web browser and you should be up and running.
