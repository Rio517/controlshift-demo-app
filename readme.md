# ControlShift Labs Demo Application

You can use the [ControlShift Labs API](http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/) to create a number of useful, embedded applications from your data in ControlShift. This example application has been created to provide a general idea of userflow. It is built with jquery and [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Feel free to fork this repo for your own needs!

The **live demo** can be found here: [http://rio517.github.io/controlshift-demo-app/](http://rio517.github.io/controlshift-demo-app/)

The ControlShift Labs **API documentation** can be found here: [http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/](http://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/).

## Developing

This application can be run independent of any tooling dependencies, but you will need a connection to the internet as bootstrap/jquery/react are pulled in via CDN.  Open the index.html file in any web browser to view.
